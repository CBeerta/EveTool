version 0.23 "Eldstrom's Effort" 2008-11-25
Eldstrom: added ServerStatus and test file, added documentation for features export to api with Quantum Rise patch.
Eldstrom: added the last test cases.
Eldstrom: Removed the cache read for the evec, as it's surplus code and cuasing a random exception.
Eldstrom: Addition of Eve central XML parsing classes, basic retrieval function and testing script.
Eldstrom: Addition of API classes CharacterName CharacterID ErrorList
Eldstrom: Addition of MemberSecurity, MemberSecurityLog and Titles, Medals, MemberMedals and Cetificatetree APIs
Eldstrom: Added getShareHolders, getContainerLog, getStandings, getConquerableStations, getMarketOrders, getKillLog, getKills, getSovereignty, getJumps, getFacWarTopStats, getFacWarStats, getFacWarSystems
Yorick: Reworked testing code to use buttons for individual tests

class.characterid.php
- Yorick: CCP fixed the XML, switched to a standard parser instead of working around the old bug

class.charactersheet.php
- Eldstrom: Changed parser to understand an arbitrary number of rowsets
- Yorick: Removed the "info" array from output; output now matches the XML in the manner all other parsers do

class.standings.php
- Eldstrom: Standings::getStandings changed to parse and return allianceStandings with the corp standings, Array returned for personal standings altered to same format as Corpstandigns

class.api.php + class.evec.php
- Eldstrom: GetCacheStatus added
- Eldstrom: isCached() add filesize check to the function else 0 sized cache files can cause fatal errors, and don't get replaced.
- Yorick: isCached() now knows "magic" $timeout value of 0, in which case it will only check that the file exists, and will not check for freshness.
  This is used when the library cannot connect to the API server or encounters an API error - you still get the cached content
- Yorick: isCached() now understands "do not cache" hint by CCP, when currentTime and cachedUntil are equal
- Yorick: Changed caching logic to not create a cache file if api->cache(FALSE)
- Eldstrom: Fixed the separator always being set to '&' after retrieveXML fetched content. It is now set back to its original value as intended.

version 0.22, 2008-08-19

class.api.php changes:
- Several users have run into issues with http_build_query using '&amp;' as a separator instead of '&' in their environment. Added some code to retrieveXML that will force it to be '&', and then
  reset it back to what it was. The alternative to use the 5.2 syntax of http_build_query was considered and rejected on the discovery that 5.1 and even 5.0 are still very common "out there"
- Removed the $cachethis parameters again, across the board - Lumy is right, that was a bad idea. Please use the api->cache() function to control caching behavior
- Changed the default caching behavior. Things will be kept in cache for the period of time that CCP specifies, unless this is overridden with the optional "timeout" parameter on the get* functions.
  Note that this library does not save you from shooting yourself in the foot - if you set timeout to a lower time than the caching value specified by CCP, the API may return errors on subsequent
  attempts to fetch data.
- With the exception of wallet data, which has a cachedUntil of 15 minutes, but returns API errors because it really only wants to be called every 60. Setting it to 65 to be safe.
  See also http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=802053.
- And added an extra 5 minutes leeway (default) into the cachedUntil and $timeout logic, to give the CCP server and your server a chance to be "off" a little on time.
- api->setTimeTolerance() can be used to adjust the above leeway.
- Fixed a bug where $params would not be reset correctly if it was not an array
- Added manual garbage collection to isCached and retrieveXml so that PHP won't run out of memory so quickly

class.starbases.php changes:
- I am using getName() in getStarbaseDetails, and that's a PHP >= 5.1.3 function only. The function now checks for that, and returns null if the PHP version is too low

class.assetlist.php changes:
- Calls to getContent prefixed with AssetList:: so that the class does not need to be instantiated for the call to work
- Changed the way getContent decides to iterate - children() contains @attributes, which led to recursion where there should have been none.

General changes:
- And for good measure, added the same manual garbage collection to all the parsing functions, as well
- Added getAssetList and getIndustryJobs functions, donated by Dustin Tinklin
- The library has moved to the LGPLv3 instead of the GPLv3. This means you are now free to use the library, and you do not have to GPLv3 the code that uses the library. If you make
  changes to the library, you do have to release those changes back to the public, even if you do not distribute your copy of the library but only use it to offer services through
  a web host. I feel that LGPLv3 gives much greater freedom all around to everyone - I get your changes to the library back, which I want; and you are free to use the library
  in a closed alliance tool if you so desire.

version 0.21b13, 2008-07-05 (release candidate)

class.api.php changes:
- Yorick: Acting on Lumy's suggestion, reworked the caching logic with a sane(r) way to create paths
- Yorick: Added individual cache timeouts to all public "get" functions
- Yorick: Acting on Lumy's suggestion, added a public function setCacheDir($dir)
- Yorick: Debug output when creating cache files
- Yorick: Clarified some debug messages
- Yorick: Fixed a bug that would zero out $params in retrieveXml, even if it was passed. Oh, Lumy found that too - changed to match Lumy's suggestion.
- Yorick: Added some BUGBUG comments for things that may need followup
- Yorick: Redid getCorporationSheet to use $corpid as a parameter. Removed $corpid from setCredentials again.
- Yorick: setCredentials will "null" out charid if it is not passed - allowing you to "go back" to charid-less credentials if you so desire
- Yorick: Changed all public "get" functions to take optional $timeout and $cachethis parameters. 
  These parameters come last, so should not break existing code.
- Yorick: Added parameter checks to all public functions, and the odd private one. This should help users that pass non-numeric charids, and the like
- Yorick: Changed the default caching behavior to be "true"

class.balance.php changes:
- Yorick: Changed the getAccountBalance parsing class. It was the only one that extended API and did its own retrieveXml. It is now in-line
  with all the other parse functions. The old functionality has been retained for backwards compatibility, as well.

class.transactions.php changes:
- Yorick: Changed the class name of Transaction to WalletTransactions and its method to getWalletTransactions, to be in line with other parsing classes. Again, the old class "Transaction" has
  been maintained for backwards compatibility, as well.

class.charactersheet.php changes:
- Yorick: Fixed a minor parsing error in getCharacterSheet()
- Yorick: Added a class SkillInTraining, to be in line with how all other parsers work

class.generic.php changes:
- Yorick: Added classes SkillTree and RefTypes, to be in line with how all other parsers work

class.membertrack.php changes:
- Yorick: Added a MemberTracking class, to be in line with how all other parsers work

class.charselect.php changes:
- Yorick: Added a Characters class, to be in line with how all other parsers work

class.starbases.php changes:
- Created parsers for getStarbaseList and getStarbaseDetail, with classes StarbaseList and StarbaseDetail, respectively

Other changes:
- Yorick: Started on API documentation in doc.rtf
- Yorick: Added API testing code in the "sample" subdirectory.
- Yorick: Consistently return "null" in parsing functions if passed parameter is empty or not a string

version 0.20r1, 2008-03-06
- Rynlam: added class.corporationsheet.php, class.alliancelist.php, and changes to class.api.php to support corpid in setCredentials

version 0.20, 2007-08-17
- original release by Kw4h
